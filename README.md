# py2048
A python implementation of Game 2048

This was a popular game around 4-5 years ago. I am recently cleaning up
my code and decided to refactor the code and publish it to the community.

## Usage

`python -m py2048` to open a new 4x4 game in command line.
Use `python -m py2048 -s [--size] size` to start a `size x size` game board.

Press `UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT` key to move.  
Press `q` to quit the game.  
Press `r` to restart a new game.

Note:  
The GUI version is under refactor and is on the way!
